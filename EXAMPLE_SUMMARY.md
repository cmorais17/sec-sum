## 1) Overall snapshot
Apple designs, manufactures and sells smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, accessories and an expanding suite of services. For fiscal 2025 the company reported total net sales of $416.2 billion, up 6% year‑over‑year, driven by Services (+14% to $109.2B) and iPhone (+4 to $209.6B, led by Pro models). Geographic performance was mixed: Americas and Europe grew (7% and 10%, respectively), Greater China declined (‑4%).

The company remains highly cash‑rich and capital‑return focused: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $132.4B as of Sept 27, 2025; Apple repurchased $89.3B of stock in 2025, announced a new $100B repurchase program and raised the quarterly dividend to $0.26. Major near‑term headwinds highlighted in the filing include intensified regulatory and legal scrutiny (EU DMA, U.S. DOJ, Epic litigation), trade/tariff risk and concentrated global supply chains.

## 2) Key risks (condensed, per Item 1A)

- Dependence on single/limited sources for custom components and outsourced contract manufacturers.  
- Product design/manufacturing defects, service outages and liability/recall risk.  
- Inventory, purchase‑commitment and asset‑write‑down risk due to short product cycles.  
- Reliance on third‑party IP and developer ecosystem; inability to license or loss of developer support.

## 5) Market risk and controls (Items 3, 7A, 4, 9A)
- Legal/regulatory (Item 3): material ongoing matters include EU DMA investigations (Article 5(4) — €500M fine and cease‑and‑desist; Article 6(4) — preliminary findings; potential DMA fines up to 10% of annual worldwide net sales and additional penalties for noncompliance), U.S. DOJ civil antitrust lawsuit alleging monopolization of smartphone markets, and the Epic Games litigation (California injunction limiting in‑app restrictions; Apple has appealed). These matters carry potential injunctions, remedies and substantial fines and may require business changes. Other ordinary‑course litigation continues; outcomes are uncertain.  
- Market risk (Item 7A): interest‑rate and FX exposures quantified — a hypothetical 100 bp increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the investment portfolio by ~$2.4B (2025) and increase annual term‑debt interest expense by ~$129M. Foreign exchange VAR model shows a 95% confidence one‑day maximum loss in fair value of foreign‑currency derivatives of $590M (2025). Company uses derivatives and hedging strategies but does not hedge all exposures.  
- Mine safety (Item 4): not applicable.  
- Controls and procedures (Item 9A): management (CEO & CFO) evaluated disclosure controls and procedures and concluded they were effective as of Sept 27, 2025. Management also concluded internal control over financial reporting was effective based on COSO criteria; Ernst & Young LLP issued the related auditor report (text not provided). Management notes inherent limitations to any control system and reported no changes in internal control over financial reporting in Q4 that materially affected controls.
